# ImageNet-Downloader
A tool for downloading ImageNet images from URL list. 

You just need to paste the list of URLs that you can get on http://image-net.org or import from a .txt file. Then you can enter a label that will be the name of the folder where all the images will be saved and choose how many images you want to download (choosen randomly).

The app will check if the image is valid and if it's not an empty image from flickr via an *.mlmodel* (only >= macOS 10.13)

You can easily download sets of images for deep learning and especially for *CreateML* (path architechture)

To do :
 - Add ImageNet Browser
 - Add auto Training and Validation folders
 - Add auto CreateML
